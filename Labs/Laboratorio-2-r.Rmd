1.    Inner-join
1.1
```{r}
flightsPlanes <- flights %>%
  inner_join(planes,by = c("tailnum"="tailnum"))

flightsPlanes
```
1.2
```{r}
flightsAirlines <-flights %>%
  inner_join(airlines,by = c("carrier"="carrier"))
flightsAirlines
```

1.3
```{r}
flightsAirports <-flights %>%
  inner_join(airports,by = c("origin"="faa"),suffix=c("_flights","_airports")) %>%
  inner_join(airports,by = c("dest"="faa"),suffix=c("_flights","_airports"))

flightsAirports

```

1.4
```{r}
flightsWeather <- flights %>%
  inner_join(weather, by= c("year","month","day","hour","origin"),suffix=c("_flights","_weather"))
flightsWeather

```
2   Data manipulation
2.1
```{r}
flights_count <- flights %>%
  count(year,month,day) %>%
  filter(n>1000) %>%
  arrange(n)

flights_count
```
2.2
```{r}
flights_selected <- flights %>%
  select(year : day,hour,origin,dest,tailnum,carrier,arr_delay,dep_delay)


flights_selected
```

2.3
```{r}
flights_selected %>%
  left_join(airlines,by = c("carrier"="carrier"))%>%
  select(-origin,-dest)%>%
  mutate(tot_delay = arr_delay+dep_delay)

```
2.4
```{r}
flightsDelay <- flights %>%
  inner_join(weather,by=NULL)%>%
  group_by(precip)%>%
  summarize(delay = mean(dep_delay,na.rm=TRUE))%>%
  replace_na(list(delay=0))
flightsDelay

```

2.5
```{r}


ggplot(flightsDelay, aes(x=precip,y=delay))+
  geom_point()



```
2.6
```{r}
filterFlights <- flights %>%
  filter(year==2013 & month == 5 & day == 10)%>%
  group_by(dest)%>%
  summarize(delay=mean(arr_delay,na.rm=TRUE))%>%
  inner_join(airports,by=c("dest","faa"))


filterFlights


```
2.7
```{r}
ggplot(flightsAirports, aes(x=lon,y=lat,color=delay))+
  geom_point()

```
